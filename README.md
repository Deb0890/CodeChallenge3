# Git Tracker

Created by [Deborah Francis](https://github.com/Deb0890) & [Daniel Cooper](https://github.com/danjcooper)

Our site is live and can be [viewed here](https://git-tracker.netlify.app/)

## Notes

Our site is live but we are currently still in the development stage and isn't fully functional but it does give you an idea of how the site will be used when it is completed.

### Installation & Usage

The site is live and can be [viewed here](https://git-tracker.netlify.app/). But to you can also do the below to view it locally.

- clone down this repo and in your terminal cd into `CodeChallenge3`.
- In your terminal use `npm run dev` to get our development build running [here](http://localhost:8080/)

### Technologies Used

- React
- Redux
- Github API
- Figma (our original designs can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/Aw6tK95gXwWAjDUf14A3kE/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1))

### Still to Implement

We are very close to having the app fully functioning, the last stage is to integrate our redux workflow into the app which is our next focus.

Thanks for reading!
